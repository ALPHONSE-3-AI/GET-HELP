Project Description

GETHELP is a locality-based service web application that connects users with nearby workers such as plumbers, electricians, and carpenters. Users can quickly search, view, and contact verified local helpers within their neighborhood.
A unique highlight of the platform is the real-time Online/Offline availability toggle for workers along with an interactive map view, enabling customers to instantly see who is available and where they are located. The system focuses on simplicity, speed, and locality filtering, making it especially useful for remote and community-level users.

Problem Statement

In many local and semi-urban communities, people struggle to quickly find reliable nearby service workers. Existing platforms are often overcrowded, city-centric, or lack real-time availability, which makes accessing trustworthy help during urgent situations difficult and time-consuming.

Proposed Solution

We are building a locality-based service web application that directly connects users with verified workers in their neighborhood.
Key solution elements include:

Locality Filters for accurate nearby results

Real-Time Online/Offline Toggle for worker availability

Integrated Map View to visually locate workers instantly

This ensures fast, simple, and dependable access to essential services, particularly for remote and community-level users.
