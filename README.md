Project Description
I have worked on a locality-based service web app that connects users with nearby workers like plumbers and electricians, where users can quickly find and contact verified local helpers. A unique feature was a real-time online/offline toggle button for workers, allowing customers to instantly see who is available also to loacte on map. The project focused on simplicity, locality filtering, and fast access to trusted services, making it especially useful for remote or neighborhood communities.

The Problem statement
In many local and semi-urban communities, people struggle to quickly find reliable nearby service workers such as plumbers, electricians, or carpenters. Existing platforms are often overcrowded, city-focused, or lack real-time availability, making it difficult to access trustworthy help during urgent situations.

The Solution
We are developing a locality-based service web application that connects users with verified workers in their neighborhood through locality filters, real-time online/offline availability toggle, and an integrated map view to locate nearby workers instantly. This ensures fast, simple, and dependable access to essential services, especially for remote and community-level users.
